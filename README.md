# Robinhood_trading_model
Close system is the trading model that hard fork the idea from Mudley Group.
This method limits the risk of the model which can be used to scout or long term trading.
The model idea is diversifying the position into several price zones because different price zones have different risks when calculated by beta.
The traders have to create their zone and their frequency of the zone by themselves and adjust by the time.

This model stimulates as many scenarios as possible. Then the model makes a plan to cover all scenarios. According to the basics, to cover all scenarios can be done by buying from zero to the price of current. 
However, the price of assets will never be zero, so the traders can also create the lowest zone to match with other models or other strategies. 
For example, I have BTC cost as $45,000 but the price comes down to between $30,000 to $35,000, so I can limit the lowest zone as $30,000 to scout with frequency as $100 which can change depending on volatility. 
The volatility can be calculated by RSI, ATR or other volatility indicators. After the BTC comes up to 40,000, I can stop the model.
The model is appropriate for sideways situations when traders struggle with other strategies. This model focuses on generating cash flow.
Moreover, Robinhood can minimize the lot sides which means traders don't have a minimum investment plan for this model.

The model can adjust the time to rebalance as every single minute or every 5 mins depends on volatility of market.
